Predig System Android Application

PredigSystem is a mobile application that allows people calculate their blood pressure, consult all their results in accessible graphics and stores the results in a database where the doctor can access it and analyses the results of a patient. Also, the app notifies if the blood pressure is lower or higher than the normal. And finally, contains a map with the hospitals and clinics near of the userâ€™s location.
