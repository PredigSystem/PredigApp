Predig System Android Application

PredigSystem is a mobile application that allows people calculate their blood pressure, consult all their results in accessible graphics and stores the results in a database where the doctor can access it and analyses the results of a patient. Also, the app notifies if the blood pressure is lower or higher than the normal. And finally, contains a map with the hospitals and clinics near of the userâ€™s location.

This application is working with the [iHealth BP5](https://ihealthlabs.com/blood-pressure-monitors/wireless-blood-pressure-monitor/) device and its [opened API available on GitHub](https://github.com/iHealthDeviceLabs/iHealthDeviceLabs-Android).

More information about the System Requirements can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbn85huq75eil08/Requirements.pdf?dl=0).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You only need the default tools for Android programming.


### Installing

First step is to clone the git repository on your computer:

```
git clone git@github.com:PredigSystem/PredigApp.git
```

At this moment you will be able to run it on a simulator or any device with an SDK version greater or equals than 15.

```
minSdkVersion 15
```

You can also customize whatever you want:
* Layouts (`res/layout` folder) have the vertical and horizontal design for each one.
* Java code distribution is:
```
predigsystem.udl.org.predigsystem
                |
                |-Activities
                |
                |-Database
                |
                |-Fragments
                |
                |-JavaClasses
```
* Almost all the layouts are fragments. `ActivityHome` the responsible of creating the `NavigationDrawer` and loading the fragments.

## Running the tests

There aren't tests at the moment. This feature will be implemented in a future.
